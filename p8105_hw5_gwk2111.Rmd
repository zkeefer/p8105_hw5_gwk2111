##Problem 1

```{r}
files = list.files(path = "data", full.names = TRUE) %>% 
  set_names(basename(.))

study_df = map_df(files, read.csv, .id = "file") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(file, into = c("control_arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(subject_id = str_sub(subject_id, start = 1, end = 2)) %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = obs, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  mutate(week = str_sub(week, start = 6, end = 6),
         week = as.numeric(week))
  
```

```{r}
ggplot(study_df, aes(x = week, y = obs, color = subject_id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~control_arm)
```

##Problem 2
